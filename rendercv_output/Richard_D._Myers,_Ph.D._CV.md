# Experience
## **Principal Software Development Scientist**, DNV -- Katy, TX (Remote)

Apr 2022 – Apr 2025

- Worked primarily on bug fixes and enhancements for SPS (Stoner Pipeline Simulator)

- Focused on technical leadership, innovation, and long-term project vision within DNV’s global engineering framework



## **Senior Software Development Scientist**, DNV -- Katy, TX (Hybrid)

July 2012 – Apr 2022

- Supported software development for state finding using adjoint methods and transient optimization for gas pipeline networks in Synergi Gas 4

- Merged software updates and tested code changes prior to internal release

- Assisted Henry Rachford with development systems

- Automated testing for Quickstart and GTO to support Richard Carter

- Implemented step doubling in SPS (Stoner Pipeline Simulator), achieving quadratic convergence of time solutions

- Expanded development work across SPS in addition to Synergi Gas 4

- Note: DNV is the corporate successor to GL Noble Denton, GL Industrial Services, and Advantica
